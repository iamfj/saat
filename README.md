## Welcome to saat ðŸŒ±

Saat (pronounced `zah-t`, like the German word for "seed") is a powerful library designed to streamline the seeding of data in your databases. Built on top of Prisma, saat leverages the Faker library to effortlessly define schemas and seed models and relations. Whether you're setting up a development environment, testing, or just need to populate a database quickly, saat makes it simpler than ever.

### Features

- **Seamless Integration with Prisma**: Works hand-in-hand with your existing Prisma setup.
- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Utilizes Faker to generate realistic and varied datasets.
- **Define Complex Relationships**: Easily seed data that respects model relationships and constraints.
- **Customizable**: Flexible API that lets you define exactly how your data should look.

### Quick Start

#### Installation

```bash
npm install prisma @saat/core
```

#### Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```typescript
import { saat, fake } from '@saat/core';
